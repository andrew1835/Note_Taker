## What, Why, and HOW
With this assignment, I wanted to use my newfound skills with express. So far, I've really struggled with backend. 
To achieve the end result, I:
1. Created a new react app 
2. Pseudo coded so that I knew how to set up my files/folders
3. Created all the correct components and pages and linked them up
4. Put it all together in the PorfolioContainer file, which was exoported to the App.js file, which is then displayed by virtue of the index.js file

The assignment was really valuable. While it's definitely possible to create an awesome portfolio with just HTML and CSS, using React not only strengthened my React skills, but also opened up a lot of opportunities for functionality when it comes to adding components to my portfolio going forward.
