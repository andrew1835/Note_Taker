## What, Why, and HOW
With this assignment, I wanted to use my newfound skills with express. So far, I've really struggled with backend. It doesn't come as easy to me as front-end, and the logic isn't as intuitive. There's a lot of syntax and boiler plate code, and I think this is part of why I find backend difficult. With front end, I can look at code and know roughly what's going on just by reading the code. I'm not there yet with backend (or at least, not where I want to be). Luckily, I was able to review the in-class activities and get help from some of my peers in order to get the app working.
To achieve the end result, I:
1. Looked at the front-end code to make sure I knew what was going on and how it was interacting with the back-end 
2. Pseudo coded the different routes
3. Wrote out the HTML routes in order to show the correct pages on screen
4. Wrote out the API routes to save all the data and display it on screen

The assignment was tricky, but really valuable. Even if I don't go into full-stack / back-end coding and instead focus on front-end for my career, I'm sure having a basic understanding
